### Application Idea
I would like to build an application for finding people to play board games with. The user should be able to search for both online and in person gatherings.
They should also be able to sort gatherings by type of game, like action, casual, multiple session. The application should allow users to create gaming groups as well
as join gatherings with those outside of their gaming group. The user should be able to create a profile with their favorite games and a photo of themselves. It would also be helpful to be able to add time and date to the gatherings.
